# birbMin

For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was 'minimalism the comeback, the awakening, the revenge Volume II Part 1 Return of the theme'.

# Blender Bit
- Took the topic very seriously this week.
- Therefore I spent a minimal amount of time on it.
- Very, very simple model.
- Like you know when you see a catwalk model interviewed?
- That kind of simple.
- There is a plane to put the 'painting' on in front of the canvas.

# Shader Bit
- Heavy usage of the [Pixel Spirit Deck](https://patriciogonzalezvivo.github.io/PixelSpiritDeck/)
- You should order a deck.
- Yes, now.
- Basically some patterns with Math.random() values thrown at them.
- Generative art the minimal effort way.
- Just set the alpha channel to the same as the pattern so it looks like its drawn on the canvas.

# JS bit & like some other bits.
- Music done with Tone.js
- It's somebody's attempt at transcribing a Phillip Glass piece.
- Thought it was funny to play Phillip Glass by clicking on the metal font.
- [Metal font is Art Dystopia 2](https://www.dafont.com/artdystopia-ii.font)
- There's a thing on the [Tone.js website](https://tonejs.github.io/Midi/) for converting midi to JSON.
- Oh, the other font is [Basement](https://grotesque.basement.studio/) which I keep using and don't think I've linked before.
- Oh part 2.0, the font that flashes briefly on the loading screen is [ferrite- core](https://github.com/froyotam/ferrite-core)
- I like fonts.
